# CSC384-Assignment
This is my attempt on CSC384-Introduction to Video Games Programming Assignment  

This module is 100% assignment based where my result depends on the assignment I handed in.  
I scored 75/100 in the implementation part and scored 12/40 in the design pattern questions part.  
In which, I only have 57% marks in this module.  

In this coursework, I implemented Pac-Man with several additional features, which includes:  
- The base game  
- A launch menu  
- A profile system  
- A replay system  
- A leaderboard feature
- A tutorial  
- An extra feature of the game with explosive collectables  
  
The game can be downloaded here:

The following video is what I submitted to the university to demonstrate my game.
